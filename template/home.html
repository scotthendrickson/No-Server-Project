  <div class='text-box'>With this translator you will be able to translate
    anything into Morse Code or from Morse Code to English. Simply type in
    what you want translated and watch the magic happen. Ok it's not really
    magic, in fact it's not even that complicated. The underlying program for
    the translation simply replaces any character you enter with it's correlating
    value. Pretty simple right?

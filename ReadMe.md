The Morse Coder by Scott Hendrickson

This was my first solo project at DevMountain where I was required to design a project that fulfilled two requirements. First was to have three UI-Routes and second was to have two Directives.

My project focused on translating English to Morse Code or back and as an added bonus it could also play the sound. The three pages fulfilled my UI-Routing requirement. For my directives I created three: Clock that updates each second, random css color generator, and the Morse Code translator. Having the translator in it's own directive allowed me to separate all of the variables into their own scope and use it anywhere I wanted as often as I wanted.
